## How to Use This Template

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get the project files to your local machine.
2.  **Open in Browser:** You can simply open any of the `.html` files in your web browser to view the pages.
3.  **Customize Content:**
    * **Text:** Update all headings, paragraphs, and list items with your agency's specific information, services, and unique selling propositions.
    * **Images:** Replace placeholder image URLs (e.g., `https://via.placeholder.com/`) with your own high-quality images and team photos.
    * **Links:** Ensure all internal navigation links (`href="page-name.html"`) and external links (social media, PDF brochure) point to the correct destinations.
    * **Google Map:** On `contact.html`, replace the placeholder `iframe src` with the actual embed code for your office location from Google Maps.
    * **Brochure:** Place your `IgniteDigital_Brochure.pdf` file in the same directory as `about-us.html` or update the `href` to its correct path.
4.  **CSS Customization:** The CSS is embedded in `<style>` tags for demonstration. For a real project, you should:
    * Move the CSS into an external file (e.g., `style.css`).
    * Link this file in the `<head>` section of each HTML page: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.
    * Modify colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements to match your brand guidelines.
5.  **Backend Integration (Crucial for Forms):**
    * The forms (`consultation.html` and `contact.html`) are set up with `action="submit_consultation.php"` and `action="submit_contact.php"` respectively. These require **backend scripts** (e.g., PHP, Node.js, Python, or a form submission service like Netlify Forms, Formspree) to actually process the data and send emails.
    * The `thank-you.html` page should be the **redirection target** after a successful form submission.
6.  **SEO Optimization:** Add more detailed meta tags (description, keywords, Open Graph tags) to each page's `<head>` section for better search engine visibility.
7.  **Accessibility:** Consider adding ARIA attributes and further optimizing for accessibility where necessary.
